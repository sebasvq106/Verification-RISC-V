=W:[DuplicateCaseItem]:
    The following case items appear more than once in             
    a case statement.  Since the first action takes precedence    
    any duplicates are effectively ignored.

=W:[MissingTimescale]:
    It is illegal for some design elements to have time specifications    
    while others don't.  A complete time specification includes           
    both a time unit and time precision.
